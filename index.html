<title>Neukölln-Berlin</title>
 
<p>"<b>Neukölln"</b> is the eponymous district of the northernmost and most densely built-up part of the Berlin district of Neukölln , which largely consists of Wilhelminian style districts . Until 1920, Neukölln was an independent town that was called Rixdorf until 1912 . The district is occasionally also referred to as Nord-Neukölln to distinguish it from the district. 

The area northeast of Hermannplatz ( Reuterkiez ) belongs to what is colloquially known as “<i>Kreuzkölln </i>” (from Kreuzberg and Neukölln). From the religious settlement in the 13th century to the village in the late Middle Ages Bethlehem Church in Deutsch-Rixdorf The former Rixdorf was founded around 1200 by the Knights Templar , who were based in Tempelhof .
Archaeological traces of Slavic pre-settlement have not yet been found. Due to desertification , the village was converted into a farm for the Knights Templar. In 1318 the possessions of the Brandenburg Knights Templar were transferred to the Order of St. John because the Templar Order had been dissolved in 1312. For this reason, the district's coat of arms bears the St. John's Cross . According to the founding document dated June 26, 1360, written in Middle Low German , the farm that had existed until thenRicharsdorp (Richarstorp/Richardstorff) converted into a village with 25 hooves . This document, which has been missing since 1945, not only contained the first written mention of Rixdorf, but was also the only existing village founding document in Brandenburg. According to the contents of the document, Rixdorf had to pay taxes to the priest of Tempelhof, so it could not have had its own village church. 


In 1375 the village of Rixdorf was mentioned in Charles IV's land register as Richardstorppmentioned, again with the 25 hooves already mentioned in the founding document, a relatively small number (the average was around 50). However, the commanders of Tempelhof no longer had all the rights. The town center was on Richardplatz . 

In 1435 the Johanniters sold all of their villages (Tempelhof, Mariendorf, Marienfelde and Rixdorf) to the cities of Berlin and Kölln . At this point at the latest, Rixdorf had its own village church . In 1525 the village was mentioned in documents as Ricksdorf . Richardsdorf and its three Low German spellings Richarsdorp, Richarstorp, Richardstorff from the 14th century developed into Reicherstorff, Richerstorp and Rigerstorp in the 15th century. In the next century Reichstorff (1541), Richstorff or Rigstorff (1542) became established, while in the 17th and 18th centuries the names Rechsdorff, Risdorf, Riechsdorf, Riecksdorf, Ricksdorf were in use. In the 19th century, Rixdorf became more and more anchored in the official directories and became established as a place name. Population increases due to immigrants from the 18th century Böhmisch- und Deutsch-Rixdorf 1857: [1] today's Richardstraße , today's Richardplatz , today's Karl-Marx-Straße Rixdorf coat of arms In 1737, Friedrich Wilhelm I allowed Bohemian exiles who had been expelled because of their Protestant faith to settle in Ricksdorf . These supporters of the Moravian Brethren built their own church and settled in their own area away from the village green , along today's Richardstrasse . The resulting Bohemian village finally received its own administration in 1797 as Bohemian Rixdorf . 

The remaining part of the settlement was called (Deutsch-)Rixdorf at this time . The two independent communities of Böhmisch-Rixdorf and Deutsch-Rixdorf were merged to form the community of Rixdorf by decree of July 11, 1873. The new community already had 8,000 residents and grew to 15,000 residents the following year. Rixdorf gains city rights and is given the name Neukölln On May 1, 1899, Rixdorf, which had 80,000 inhabitants at the time and had previously been part of the Teltow district as the largest village in Prussia , formed its own urban district and received town rights.  In 1903, Rixdorf received its coat of arms, with the St. John's Cross and the chalice (for the Bohemian religious refugees). The renaming of Rixdorf to Neukölln took place with the consent of Kaiser Wilhelm II on his 53rd birthday on January 27, 1912 and was decided by the authorities because Rixdorf had now become the epitome of frivolous entertainment for Berliners, the then – and some of them are still popular todayGassenhauer In Rixdorf is Musike expresses this. The negative image of the place should be removed with the name. The name Neucölln is derived from the Neucölln settlements located north of the old Rixdorf, which indicate the location at the southern gates of the old Berlin - Cölln (cf. Neu-Kölln ). 1920 part of Greater Berlin Rixdorf train station in 1901, Neukölln train station since 1912 With the Greater Berlin Act (law on the formation of a new municipality of Berlin) passed by the Prussian state parliament in the spring of 1920, numerous surrounding towns were united to form Greater Berlin on October 1, 1920 and the urban district of Neukölln together with the villages of Britz , Rudow and Buckow to the 14th administrative district . With the regional reform in 2001 as part of the Berlin administrative reform, the Neukölln district became Berlin's 8th administrative district.
